Instructions for making GEN-only ntuples
----------------------------------------

o Make the input filelists from ntuples in Andreas' EOS area.  Filelists can be made for 2 MC samples:  pythia8 and herwig. The sample type can be changed by updating the MCSAMPLE variable in makeFilelists.py.  Both MC samples have the same mass binning. MCSAMPLE should be the only variable that needs changing. Filelists will go in filelists directory will be created automatically when running the script.

> python makeFilelists.py


o Make configuration files. This is done using the makeCFGS.py python script.  In this script, the OutDir variable should be updated to point to a writable EOS directory.  After that configuration files should be created for every smearing scenario that is to be studied.  The variables to be changed are located in between the ##### delineators.  Also, if the number of input files per filelist has been changed in makeFilelists.py, the NCFGs variable should be updated in this script to match. The configuration files will go into an output directory called genCFGS. It will be created automatically when running the script.

> python makeCFGS.py

o Run the submitGen.sh script to submit the jobs to the CERN batch system.  Update the GENR variable to run Pythia8 or Herwig MC. TRUNC should be set to 0 for Gaussian smearing, or 2 for Crystal Ball smearing. Finally, the CFGDIR directory should be updated for making ntuples for Gaussian core smearing with +- 1 sigma uncertainties.
